HORMONES
Test Name Result Unit Bio.Ref.Range Method
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone
TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) 6.290 mIU/ml Normal:- 0.35-5.5 CLIA
Interpretation:
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is synthesized and secreted by the anterior pituitary in response to a negative feedback mechanism involving 
concentrations of FT3 (free T3) and FT4 (free T4). Additionally, the hypothalamic tripeptide, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), directly stimulates TSH 
production. TSH stimulates thyroid cell production and hypertrophy, also stimulate the thyroid gland to synthesize and secrete T3 and T4. Quantification of TSH 
is significant to differentiate primary (thyroid) from secondary (pituitary) and tertiary (hypothalamus) hypothyroidism. In primary hypothyroidism, TSH levels 
are significantly elevated, while in secondary and tertiary hypothyroidism, TSH levels are low.
TSH levels During Pregnancy :
First Trimester :0.1 to 2.5 µIU/mL
Second Trimester : 0.2 to 3.0 µIU/mL
Third trimester : 0.3 to 3.0 µIU/mL
TSH levels in infants and children
Age                     TSH (mIU/mL)
Cord blood     2.2 to 10.7
1 to 4 days     2.7 to 26.5
4 to 30 days     1.2 to 13.1
1 to 12 months    0.6 to 7.3
1 to 5 years     0.7 to 6.6
6 to 10 years     0.8 to 6.0

HbA1c ( Glycemic control ) :
Overview
The A1C test is a common blood test used to diagnose type 1 and type 2 diabetes and to monitor how well you're managing your diabetes. The A1C test goes by 
many other names, including glycated hemoglobin, glycosylated hemoglobin, hemoglobin A1C and HbA1c. The A1C test result reflects your average blood sugar 
level for the past two to three months. Specifically, the A1C test measures what percentage of your hemoglobin — a protein in red blood cells that carries 
oxygen — is coated with sugar (glycated). The higher your A1C level, the poorer your blood sugar control and the higher your risk of diabetes complications.
Limitations
HBF > 25% and in other hemoglobinopathies an alternate platform is recommened for testing of HbA1C. Trends in HbA1C are better indicator of dibetic control 
than a single test result.
